# Data Science with GitHub Codespaces

This workshop walks through getting started with setting up a Data Science Environment in GitHub Codespaces.

Make sure you have a:

- GitHub Account
- Azure Account: [Sign up for Azure for Students](https://aka.ms/azure4students) and get $100 of credit with an .edu account.

## Setup

1. Fork this repository
2. In the main page of the repository, under the repository name, use the Code drop-down menu, and in the Codespaces tab, select "Create codespace on main".
3. Wait as GitHub initializes the codespace:

## Inspect your codespaces environment

What you have at this point is a pre-configured environment where all the runtimes and libraries you need are already installed - a zero config experience.

You also have a Jupyter Notebook that you can start using without any configuration.

> This environment will run the same regardless of whether your students are on Windows, macOS or Linux.

Open up your Jupyter Notebook file [notebook.ipynb](notebook.ipynb) and follow instructions in the notebook.
