# Data Science and Machine Learning on Azure

This lab shows how to debug machine learning models using the Responsible AI (RAI) dashboard in Azure Machine Learning studio. The goal of the lab is for users to get hands-on learning on how to train a model and use the Responsible AI dashboard to debug the model in order to improve the model's performance to be more fair, inclusive, safe & reliable, and transparent. User learn how to use RAI dashboard to build AI solutions that are less harmful to society; more trustworthy and meet some industry compliance requirements.

TOPICS:
The topics that will be covered in this section with be:
	- Error Analysis
	- Model Overview
	- Data Analysis
	- Feature Importance

DATA
We will be using the Diabetes Hospital Readmission dataset in our classification use case.  The dataset is from [UCI's Diabetes 130-US hospitals for years 1999-2008 Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Diabetes+130-US+hospitals+for+years+1999-2008#). The trained model used in this workshop classifies if a diabetic patient with be Readmitted or Not Readmitted back to a hospital within 30 days after they have be discharged.
